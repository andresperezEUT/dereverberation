### Dereverberation

A lot of poorly organized code, including the `experiments` folder 
(which is better organized as the [ambisonic_rt_estimation](https://github.com/andresperezlopez/ambisonic_rt_estimation) repo).
There are some other implementations of dereverberation code hidden around, specially from S. Braun dissertation.

sorry!
Please contact me if you try to do something with this stuff.
